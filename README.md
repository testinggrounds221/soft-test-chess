Chess_Game_Java
===============

A description of the logic behind a chess game with an OOP implementation. Logic for all moves is given, including checks for check, checkmate, etc. This was developed with my friend for CS-242 (UIUC), where I assisted my friend in the project. I will be developing a UI using Java for the game soon, including the implementation of Castling.
